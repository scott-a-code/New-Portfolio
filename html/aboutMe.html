                        <p>Having lived all my life in London, i've grow up as a city boy, first attending St.Georges primary school and then moving onto Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School for secondary and sixth form education. It was here I developed my interest in how things worked studying Chemistry, physics & Maths.</p>

                        <p>Applying to study Chemistry, this was the first university I visited but was immediately taken with the diverse campus lifestyle and quality of the Chemistry undergraduate labs. I excelled at Organic Chemistry in particular and stayed on for a 4th year to complete my integrated Masters. Despite the intensity of the course I also made full use of the societies on offer, firstly being coerced into trying Cheerleading by a friend as part of their 'bring-a-guy' event and then Breakdancing! Finally I returned to the growing Chemistry society when I actively participated in events such as revision classes for the lower years, making many great friends who I still have to this day!</p>

                        <p>After university I felt it would be of benefit to my interpersonal skills by hainvg a customer facing role in retail. Starting off on the shop floor where I experienced almost every kind of customer from eccentrics, to the rude & from the famous (Lewis Hamilton & the Beckhams) to the majority who just wanted to get in and out. After a few months I took on more responsibility working as an accessibility & availability advisor, working more closely with management to ensure there was the minimal wasted product possible.</p>

                        </h1>
                        <p>Feeling like I'd achieved what I had set out to do I wanted to change my career path and utilise a larger subset of the skills and knowledge I had gained at university and put my degree to some use! I later joined a Market Research company focused in the pharma sphere called DoubleHelix, which would eventually go on to become Consulting at McCann Health. Here I garnered a lot of experience and made yet more close friends as we worked closely in project teams, supporting one another through numerous challenges that came with running adhoc style projects. However all good things come to an end and amongst the harsh environment Covid produced, I felt it better to persue a more technological based role marking the end & new beginning of chapters in my life...
